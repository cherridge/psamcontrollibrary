PSAM Control Library is a WinForms library containing the IncipitViewer control for drawing musical notes which can be read from MusicXml file or added programmatically. The library was initially a component of larger software Polish System for Archivising Music (http://www.archiwistykamuzyczna.pl/?lang=en) but I thought it could be useful for other software developers, so I decided to distribute it under BSD licence. PSAM Control Library is written in C# under Microsoft Visual Studio Express.
